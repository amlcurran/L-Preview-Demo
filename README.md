Lollipop UI Demos
==============

A demo project using the new APIs available in Android Lollipop, 5.0. This highlights some really exciting new UI items in the SDK, with easy to understand code demos (all of which are open source!). 

This followed on from my code discussion at the BBC on 18th Sept, and the resulting talk at Android Manchester on 17th Nov. Any questions, please ask.
